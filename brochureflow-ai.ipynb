    "## The Three-Stage Intelligence Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "BrochureFlow AI operates through a sophisticated three-stage workflow that mimics how expert marketing professionals approach brochure creation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 1:** Smart Web Analysis - The system automatically scrapes and analyzes your company's website, identifying the most relevant pages and information for brochure creation. Using multishot prompting with diverse examples, it learns to distinguish between essential company information and irrelevant content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 2:** Dual-Tone Content Generation - The tool creates two distinct versions of your brochure: a professional version for formal business settings and a humorous, engaging version for casual marketing. Each uses multishot prompting with carefully curated examples to maintain consistency and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 3:** Cultural Localization - For businesses targeting diverse markets, BrochureFlow AI includes advanced language adaptation, featuring specialized Thanglish (Tamil-English mix) translation that captures the natural code-switching patterns of bilingual communities."
